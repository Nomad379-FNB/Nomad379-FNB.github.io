Half of the food produced in the US goes to waste, while over a billion people go hungry every day. How can we as a society justify nearly a trillion dollars funding the US military industry each year while poverty and homelessness ravage our neighbors? Food Not Bombs challenges the injustice of the status quo. Thousands of chapters around the world rescue good, fresh produce bound to be discarded as surplus. We cook this reclaimed food into healthy vegan/vegetarian meals and feed the hungry. We are not a charity. We are a decentralized group of folks fed up with a system that creates poverty, standing in solidarity with those people society has left behind.
